# Titanic-disaster-prediction
This is the first practice project after I have completed the introduction course [Machine Learning A-Z on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/) and the first two courses of [Andrew Ng 's deep learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

The dataset is taken from Kaggle's ["Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition.
